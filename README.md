###### Note:

-Solutions in this repo are neither the fastest nor are they the most efficient.
-You might find similarities between the solutions in this repo and any other openly available solutions on the internet. This may be a result of me taking an inspiration from that solution or just sheer coincidence.
-I have also added a few questions on databases that I've practised.
