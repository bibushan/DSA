## About

Initiated on 16th May, 2022, the aim of project LEADS is to learn, practice and explore theoretical knowledge and practical skills in the concepts of Algorithms and Data Structures.\
This [repo](https://github.com/bibushan/project-LEADS) contains my solutions to various coding problems I've solved on platforms like LeetCode, CODECHEF etc..\
The solutions are written in Java, C++ and Python.
